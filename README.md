The primary goal of this project is to construct a robot chassis equipped with fundamental
 components such as Arduino, motors, wheels, and a strategically positioned camera. The esp32
 cam integrated with the Arduino system is used to capture real time footage and tries to map
 according to the motion.
 This project tries to achieve the function of autonomous exploration along with self-navigation
 and mapping. Even though the challenges like integrating the camera module with Arduino and
 developing efficient navigation algorithms are present, the project aims to solve these using
 diligent planning and innovative problem-solving.
